Seneca LDAP implementation for BigBlueButton
March 2012 Seneca College

To appear in the API demos, the "demo" folder must be copied to /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/demo (you may need to sudo yourself some permissions first)

You may need to add the commons-lang-2.5 package to use the LDAP example. Find it here: http://www.classnotfound.com/package.html?jarId=64581
