Seneca LDAP implementation for BigBlueButton
March 2012 Seneca College

To appear in the API demos, the "demo" folder must be copied to /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/demo (you may need to sudo yourself some permissions first)

You may need to add the commons-lang-2.5 package to use the LDAP example. Find it here: http://www.classnotfound.com/package.html?jarId=64581


To get the login app to work you must run these two commands from within the repo directory.
> sudo cp auth.nginx /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx
> sudo service nginx restart

Then run:
> sudo cp -r auth /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
you'll have to do this everytime you update a jsp page.

If you modify the java files in java-ldap-test you have to copy the contents of the class files from the bin directory to auth/WEB-INF/classes directory manually. You then have to run:
> sudo service tomcat6 restart
to get tomcat to see your changes.
