Seneca LDAP implementation for BigBlueButton
March 2012 Seneca College

To appear in the API demos, the "demo" folder must be copied to /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/demo (you may need to sudo yourself some permissions first)

You may need to add the commons-lang-2.5 package to use the LDAP example. Find it here: http://www.classnotfound.com/package.html?jarId=64581


To get the login app to work you must run these two commands from within the repo directory.
> sudo cp auth.nginx /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx
> sudo service nginx restart

***NEW***
I have completely changed the way the auth app works. I've figured out a way to create an actual web project within Eclipse. In order to set up the Eclipse project you have to follow the following steps:

1. Run these commands to allow Eclipse access to tomcat
> sudo apt-get install tomcat6
> cd /usr/share/tomcat6
> sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat6/conf conf
> sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat6/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy
> sudo ln -s /var/log/tomcat6 log
> sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/tomcat6/conf

2. Install the required Eclipse plugins
> In Eclipse go to Help->Install New Sofware->Work with->Galileo Update Site
> Select the complete package "Web,XML,Java EE Development", expand the option and deselect "PHP Development Tools" and "Rich Ajax Platform"
> Select Next->Finish
> Wait for the plugins to install

3. Set up Eclipse environment
> In Eclipse go to Window->Preferences->Server->Runtime Environments->Add...
> Select Apache Tomcatv6.0
> Click Next
> Under "Tomcat installation directory" click Browse->navigate to->"/usr/share/tomcat6"
> Click Finish

4. Setting up the server
> In a terminal window type "sudo service tomcat6 stop"
> In Eclipse go to Windows->Show View->Servers
> Find where the Servers view was placed and if there's no "Tomcat v6.0 Server" entry right-click the view and select New->Server
> Select the server that you created in step 3

5. Setting up the project
> Switch to the Java EE perspective
> Select File->New->Dynamic Web Project
> Name it whatever you want and set the Directory to the auth directory in your ldap repo
> Click finish

6. Running your project
> In the Servers view click the green play button
> In a browser navigate to "http://142.204.133.31/auth/login.jsp"
> Ta-da

No more file moving or copying of files just start and stop the server from within Eclipse when you want to make a change.
